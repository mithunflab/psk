# Running the Onlook Project

You have a complete Next.js onlook project in `apps/web/client` that should be run instead of the current Vite setup.

## Solution Options:

### Option 1: Update package.json to point to onlook client
I can modify the main package.json to run the onlook client directly.

### Option 2: Set up workspace properly
I can set up the workspace configuration to properly run the onlook project.

### Option 3: Copy onlook components to current structure
I can copy the working onlook components to work with the current Vite setup.

## Current Issue:
- You have a working Next.js app in `apps/web/client` with all features
- The current project is set up as a Vite app in the root
- We need to either switch to running the onlook client or properly integrate it

Which approach would you prefer? I recommend Option 1 (updating package.json to run the onlook client directly) as it will give you all the features immediately.
